#Solution : https://youtu.be/Qttkfhh3I5s

### Define a simple nextDay procedure, that assumes
### every month has 30 days.
###
### For example:

## Test Next Day
## Test case nextDay(2012, 1, 1) : good
## Test case nextDay(2012, 12, 1): good

## Test Next Month
## Test case nextDay(2012, 4, 30) is not correct!

## Test Next Year
## Test case nextDay(1999, 12, 30) is not correct!
## Test case nextDay(2012, 12, 30) is not correct!

def nextDay(year, month, day):
    """
    Returns the year, month, day of the next day.
    Simple version: assume every month has 30 days.
    """
    # YOUR CODE HERE

    if(day < 30):
       return year, month, day + 1
    else:
        if(month < 12):
            return year, month + 1, 1
        else:
            return year + 1, 1, 1
    
            
print(nextDay(2012, 12, 30))

## Step Three daysBetweenDates

```python

# correct output if there was a correct nextDay procedure.

# Note that this will NOT produce correct outputs yet, since
# our nextDay procedure assumes all months have 30 days
# (hence a year is 360 days, instead of 365).

A stub is a dummy implementation of the method. It can be used for testing before you code the whole function.

In order to answer this question, you should think about the dependencies between the various steps, but also about what order of implementing and testing them will be most likely to efficiently lead to a correct solution.

It's definitely a subjective question, and there are many reasonable answers to this question. Because of this, your answer will not be graded. But watching the instructor explain his solution will help you evaluate your solution.

## Introduction to Maps
In Python, the map concept appears as a built-in data type called a dictionary. A dictionary contains key-value pairs. Dictionaries might soon become your favorite data structure in Python—they're extremely easy to use and useful. Here's a sample of setting up a dictionary.

```python

udacity = {}
udacity['u'] = 1
udacity['d'] = 2
udacity['a'] = 3
udacity['c'] = 4
udacity['i'] = 5
udacity['t'] = 6
udacity['y'] = 7

print (udacity)
# {'u': 1, 'd': 2, 'a': 3, 'c': 4, 'i': 5, 't': 6, 'y': 7}


```

In this case, the letters in "udacity" were each keys in our dictionary, and the position of that letter in the string was the value. Thus, I can do the following:

```python
print (udacity['t'])
# 6

```

This statement is saying "go to the key labeled 't' and find it's value, 6".

Dictionaries are wonderfully flexible—you can store a wide variety of structures as values. You store another dictionary or a list:

```python

dictionary = {}
dictionary['d'] = [1]
dictionary['i'] = [2]
dictionary['c'] = [3]
dictionary['t'] = [4]
dictionary['i'].append(5)
dictionary['o'] = [6]
dictionary['n'] = [7]
dictionary['a'] = [8]
dictionary['r'] = [9]
dictionary['y'] = [10]
print (dictionary)
# {'d': [1], 'i': [2, 5], 'c': [3], 't': [4], 'o': [6], 'n': [7], 'a': [8], 'r': [9], 'y':[10]}


```

Time to play with Python dictionaries! You're going to work on a dictionary that stores cities by country and continent. One is done for you - the city of Mountain View is in the USA, which is in North America.

You need to add the cities listed below by modifying the structure. Then, you should print out the values specified by looking them up in the structure.

Cities to add: Bangalore (India, Asia) Atlanta (USA, North America) Cairo (Egypt, Africa) Shanghai (China, Asia)

locations = {'North America': {'USA': ['Mountain View']}}

Print the following (using "print").

1. A list of all cities in the USA in alphabetic order.
2. All cities in Asia, in alphabetic order, next to the name of the country. In your output, label each answer with a number so it looks like this:
    1
    American City
    American City
    2
    Asian City - Country
    Asian City - Country


```python

locations = {'North America': {'USA': ['Mountain View']}}
locations['North America']['USA'].append('Atlanta')
locations['Asia'] = {'India': ['Bangalore']}
locations['Asia']['China'] = ['Shanghai']
locations['Africa'] = {'Egypt': ['Cairo']}

usa_sorted = sorted(locations['North America']['USA'])
print (1)
for city in usa_sorted:
    print (city)

asia_cities = []
print (2)
for countries, cities in locations['Asia'].items():
    city_country = cities[0] + " - " + countries 
    asia_cities.append(city_country)
asia_sorted = sorted(asia_cities)
for city in asia_sorted:
    print (city)



```

## Hash Maps Notebook
(In addition to having fun) We write programs to solve real world problems. Data structures help us in representing and efficiently manipulating the data associated with these problems.

Let us see if we can use any of the data structures that we already know to solve the following problem

## Problem Statement
In a class of students, store heights for each student.

The problem in itself is very simple. We have the data of heights of each student. We want to store it so that next time someone asks for height of a student, we can easily return the value. But how can we store these heights?

Obviously we can use a database and store these values. But, let's say we don't want to do that for now. We want to use a data structure to store these values as part of our program. For the sake of simplicity, our problem is limited to storing heights of students. But you can certainly imagine scenarios where you have to store such key-value pairs and later on when someone gives you a key, you can efficiently return the corrresponding value.

The class diagram for HashMaps would look something like this.

```python

class HashMap:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.num_entries = 0
    
    def put(self, key, value):
        pass
    
    def get(self, key):
        pass
    
    def size(self):
        return self.num_entries


```

## Arrays
Can we use arrays to store key-value pairs?

We can certainly use one array to store the names of the students and use another array to store their corresponding heights at the corresponding indices.

What will be the time complexity in this scenario?

To obtain height of a student, say Potter, Harry, we will have to traverse the entire array and check if the value at a particular index matches Potter, Harry. Once we find the index in which this value is stored, we can use this index to obtain the height from the second array.

Thus, because of this traveral, complexity for get() operation becomes  𝑂(𝑛) . Even if we maintain a sorted array, the operation will not take less than  𝑂(𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑛))  complexity.

What happens if a student leaves a class? We will have to delete the entry corresponding to the student from both the arrays.

This would require another traversal to find the index. And then we will have to shift our entire array to fill this gap. Again, the time complexity of operation becomes  𝑂(𝑛)

## Linked List
Is it possible to use linked lists for this problem?

We can certainly modify our LinkedListNode to have two different value attributes - one for name of the student and the other for height.

But we again face the same problem. In the worst case, we will have to traverse the entire linked list to find the height of a particular student. Once again, the cost of operation becomes  𝑂(𝑛) .

## Stacks and Queues
Stacks and Queues are LIFO and FIFO data structures respectively. Can you think why they too do not make a good choice for storing key-value pairs?

Can we do better? Can you think of any data structure that allows for fast get() operation?

Let us circle back to arrays.

When we obtain the element present at a particular index using something like arr[3], the operation takes constant i.e. O(1) time.

For review - Does this constant time operation require further explanation?

If we think about array indices as keys and the element present at those indices as values, we can fairly conclude that at least for non-zero integer keys, we can use arrays.

However, like our current problem statement, we may not always have integer keys.

If only we had a function that could give us arrays indices for any key value that we gave it!

## Hash Functions
Simply put, hash functions are these really incredible magic functions which can map data of any size to a fixed size data. This fixed sized data is often called hash code or hash digest.

## ASCII Table

Let's create our own hash function to store strings

```python

def hash_function(string):
    hash_code = 0
    for character in string:
        hash_code += ord(character)
    return hash_code
  
hash_code_1 = hash_function("abcd")
print(hash_code_1)


```

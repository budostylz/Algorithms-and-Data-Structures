# Efficiency
We said earlier that this Nanodegree program is about how to write code to solve problems and to do so efficiently.

In the last section, we looked at some basic aspects of solving problems—but we didn't really think too much about whether our solutions were efficient.

## Space and time
When we refer to the efficiency of a program, we aren't just thinking about its speed—we're considering both the time it will take to run the program and the amount of space the program will require in the computer's memory. Often there will be a trade-off between the two, where you can design a program that runs faster by selecting a data structure that takes up more space—or vice versa.

Algorithms
        An algorithm is essentially a series of steps for solving a problem. Usually, an algorithm takes some kind of input (such as an unsorted list) and then produces the desired output (such as a sorted list).

For any given problem, there are usually many different algorithms that will get you to exactly the same end result. But some will be much more efficient than others. To be an effective problem solver, you'll need to develop the ability to look at a problem and identify different algorithms that could be used—and then contrast those algorithms to consider which will be more or less efficient.

## But computers are so fast!
Sometimes it seems like computers run programs so quickly that efficiency shouldn't really matter. And in some cases, this is true—one version of a program may take 10 times longer than another, but they both still run so quickly that it has no real impact.

But in other cases, a small difference in how your code is written—or a tiny change in the type of data structure you use—can mean the difference between a program that runs in a fraction of a millisecond and a program that takes hours (or even years!) to run.

## Quantifying efficiency
It's fine to say "this algorithm is more efficient than that algorithm", but can we be more specific than that? Can we quantify things and say how much more efficient the algorithm is?

Let's look at a simple example, so that we have something specific to consider.

Although the two functions have the exact same end result, one of them iterates many times to get to that result, while the other iterates only a couple of times.

This was admittedly a rather impractical example (you could skip the for loop altogether and just add 200 to the input), but it nevertheless demonstrates one way in which efficiency can come up.

## Counting lines
With the above examples, what we basically did was count the number of lines of code that were executed. Let's look again at the first function:

```python

def some_function(n):
    for i in range(2):
        n += 100
    return n

```

There are four lines in total, but the line inside the for loop will get run twice. So running this code will involve running 5 lines.

Now let's look at the second example:

```python

def other_function(n):
    for i in range(100):
        n += 2
    return n

```
In this case, the code inside the loop runs 100 times. So running this code will involve running 103 lines!

Counting lines of code is not a perfect way to quantify efficiency, and we'll see that there's a lot more to it as we go through the program. But in this case, it's an easy way for us to approximate the difference in efficiency between the two solutions. We can see that if Python has to perform an addition operation 100 times, this will certainly take longer than if it only has to perform an addition operation twice!

# Big O Notation
When describing the efficiency of an algorithm, we could say something like "the run-time of the algorithm increases linearly with the input size". This can get wordy and it also lacks precision. So as an alternative, mathematicians developed a form of notation called big O notation.

The "O" in the name refers to the order of the function or algorithm in question. And that makes sense, because big O notation is used to describe the order—or rate of increase—in the run-time of an algorithm, in terms of the input size (n).

In this next video, Brynn will show some different examples of what the notation would actually look like in practice. This likely won't "click" for you right away, but don't worry—once you've gotten some experience applying it to real problems, it will be much more concrete.

# Big O Notation (2/2)
In the examples we've looked at here, we've been approximating efficiency by counting the number of lines of code that get executed. But when we are thinking about the run-time of a program, what we really care about is how fast the computer's processor is, and how many operations we're asking the processor to perform. Different lines of code may demand very different numbers of operations from the computer's processor. For now, counting lines will work OK as an approximation, but as we go through the course you'll see that there's a lot more going on under the surface.

## Worst Case and Approximation
Suppose that we analyze an algorithm and decide that it has the following relationship between the input size, n, and the number of operations needed to carry out the algorithm:

 N = n^2 + 5


Where n is the input size and N is the number of operations required.

For example, if we gave this algorithm an input of 2, the number of required operations would be 2^2 + 5 or simply 9.

The thing to notice in the above exercise, is this: In n^2 + 5n, the 5 has very little impact on the total efficiency—especially as the input size gets larger and larger. Asking the computer to do 10,005 operations vs. 10,000 operations makes little difference. Thus, it is the n^2 that we really care about the most, and the +5 makes little difference.

Most of the time, when analyzing the efficiency of an algorithm, the most important thing to know is the order. In other words, we care a lot whether the algorithm's time-complexity has a linear order or a quadratic order (or some other order). This means that very often (in fact, most of the time) when you are asked to analyze an algorithm, you can do so by making an approximation that significantly simplifies things. In this next video, Brynn will discuss this concept and show how it's used with Big O Notation.

# Space Complexity
<a href="https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/February/5c6498ff_worst-case-and-approximation-3-v1/worst-case-and-approximation-3-v1_720p.mp4">Space Efficiency</a>


## Space Complexity Examples
When we refer to space complexity, we are talking about how efficient our algorithm is in terms of memory usage. This comes down to the datatypes of the variables we are using and their allocated space requirements. In Python, it's less clear how to do this due to the the underlying data structures using more memory for house keeping functions (as the language is actually written in C).

For example, in C/C++, an integer type takes up 4 bytes of memory to store the value, but in Python 3 an integer takes 14 bytes of space. Again, this extra space is used for housekeeping functions in the Python language.

For the examples of this lesson we will avoid this complexity and assume the following sizes:

![Space Complexity](https://github.com/budostylz/Algorithms-and-Data-Structures/blob/master/Efficiency/space_complexity.PNG "Space Complexity")

It is also important to note that we will be focusing on just the data space being used and not any of the environment or instructional space.

```python

def our_constant_function():

    x = 3 # Type int
    y = 345 # Type int
    z = 11 # Type int

    answer = x+y+z

    return answer
```

So in this example we have four integers (x, y, z and answer) and therefore our space complexity will be 4*4 = 16 bytes. This is an example of constant space complexity, since the amount of space used does not change with input size.

```python

def our_linear_function(n):

    n = n # Type int
    counter = 0 # Type int
    list_ = [] # Assume that the list is empty (i.e., ignore the fact that there is actually meta data stored with Python lists)

    while counter < n:
        list. append(counter)
        counter = counter + 1

    return list_
    
```

So in this example we have two integers (n and counter) and an expanding list, and therefore our space complexity will be 4*n + 8 since we have an expanding integer list and two integer data types. This is an example of linear space complexity.
